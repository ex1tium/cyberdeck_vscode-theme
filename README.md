# Cyberdeck theme for VS Code
![Icon](./128x128_icon.png)

Based on theme 'Kabukicho' by victoriadrake https://github.com/victoriadrake/kabukicho-vscode with modified syntax hilight colors and less bling. Which is based on several other themes. 
Customized to my own tastes, but I hope you like it too. **Not published to the marketplace, so you'll have to install it manually.**

## Notes

There is `./helpers/` folder with some python scripts to help with theme development. They are not necessary for the theme to work, but they are useful for me. You can ignore them.
